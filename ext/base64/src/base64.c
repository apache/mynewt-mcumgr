/*
 * This file is based on roken from the FreeBSD source.  It has been modified
 * to not use malloc() and instead expect static buffers, and tabs have been
 * replaced with spaces.  Also, instead of strlen() on the resulting string,
 * pointer arithmitic is done, as p represents the end of the buffer.
