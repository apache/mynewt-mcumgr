    LOG_MGMT_CHUNK_LEN:
        description: >
            Limits the maximum length of log entry bodies chunks, so, every log entry gets
            read in chunks upto a point where the entire entry is read. Also, a buffer gets
            allocated on the stack with this size.
        value: 128

    LOG_MGMT_MAX_RSP_LEN:
        description: >
            Limits the maximum chunk len for log downloads, in bytes.
        value: 512

    LOG_MGMT_NAME_LEN:
        description: >
            Limits the maximum length of log names, in bytes. If a log's name length
            exceeds this number, it gets truncated in management responses. A buffer
            of this size gets allocated on the stack during handling of all log
            management commands.
        value: 64
