    STAT_MGMT_MAX_NAME_LEN:
        description: >
            Limits the maximum stat group name length in mcumgr requests, in bytes.
            A buffer of this size gets allocated on the stack during handling of all
            stat read commands.  If a stat group's name exceeds this limit, it will
            be impossible to retrieve its values with a stat show command.
        value: 32
